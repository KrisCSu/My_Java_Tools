# My Java Tools

A collection of Java based tools with JavaFX frontend.



<<<<<<< HEAD
These tools were built between 2016-2017 in the purpose of studying JavaFX. There were 30+ tools built and most of them are just very simple and not useful projects, therefore I decided just uploaded these few tools which I believe are useful.
